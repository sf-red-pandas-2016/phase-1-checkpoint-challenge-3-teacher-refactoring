# Super Crazy Bonus Release

Edit this file to answer the following questions. Give examples. You may need to do a bit of research. :)

1. Why is Hash.fetch useful?

using .fetch allows us to set a default value if nothing is entered in as a value to our hash argument. Also allows us to pass a block.

2. What is the disadvantage of single inheritance, and what's a possible solution to that problem?

The problem with single inheritance is that every child inherits everything from the parent even if you don't want a few of the behaviors. Modules can be used as as solution.

3. Why are these classes initialized with an options hash?

  It is useful to initialize classes with an options hash because your arguments do not have to be in order and arguments can be added or kept out much easier.

4. What is the purpose of the private keyword in a class? What does it protect you from and why is that valuable?

  The private keyword makes it so methods are not accessible outside the class. This can hide algorithms or info you do not want the user to see when using the object.

5. Why are concepts like encapsulation, single responsibility, and abstraction important? Now that you've been programming for a while, have you seen any advantages for yourself, or can you imagine them in the future?

  All of these concepts make our code more flexible and less dependent, allowing for free-flowing changes without breaking everything.
